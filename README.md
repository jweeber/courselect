# Courselect

Site that provides search capability across multiple online course websites, pulling in data from third-party APIs. Search for courses by title or keyword and get a list of courses available to take from 3-4 online courses sites, including links to those courses. Users will be able to sign up/log in to add courses to a list of "courses to take" and mark courses they have completed.

## Learning Goals
- Solidify knowledge of how to use third-party APIs in Rails.
- Focus on TDD
- Practice setting up User Auth 
- Gain more exposure to reading and interpreting third-party API documentation.
- Use more Bootstrap functionality & features.

## Target Audience
Anyone who has ever wished they could just search for online courses in one place (this includes me)!
